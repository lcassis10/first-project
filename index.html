                <p>
                    Brazil takes up 50 percent of the land in South America and sits right on the Atlantic Ocean – so it's no surprise that it's full of golden beaches and access to some of the most beautiful coastlines in the continent.

If one of the main reasons you're heading to Brazil is to work on your tan, you won't be disappointed. Here, you can choose to lay down on the beach for hours or explore the surrounding trails and hills, and you'll end up with a golden hue either way.

                <p>
                    The Amazon Rainforest is hands down the most impressive of Brazil’s natural features. The forest encompasses the basin of the Amazon River, the mightiest in volume on Earth (and arguably the longest too).
                    The biggest rainforest in the world would be the seventh largest country if it became a sovereign nation. While it’s split between nine South American countries, 60% are within Brazil. 

You’ll need to spend at least a few days in the region to explore it.

                <p>
                    Waterfalls in Brazil are among the largest fall systems in the world. People from all over the world visit Brazil to see them. Several popular natural tourists destinations in Brazil are famous due to their waterfalls and several of them have been declared as natural heritage sites. As the world’s largest river, Amazon, flows here, it is only natural that some of the unexplored waterfalls are housed here

                    Brazilian cuisine is not only historic, but also varied, tasty, and part of the different cultures all around the country. In fact, some dishes and recipes are exclusive to some regions, while other types of food are quite traditional all over Brazil. If you love trying new flavors, Brazil is the perfect destination for you.
